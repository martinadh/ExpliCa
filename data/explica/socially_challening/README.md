# Socially challenging data

Among the causal sentence pairs in ExpliCa, 50 are labeled as 'socially challenging', indicating content that touches on sensitive or potentially offensive topics such as religion, abortion, immigration, gender identity, drug abuse, and bribery. 

Some items may be offensive to certain groups.

However, the themes contained in these items were added to evaluate whether bias-mitigation strategies in LLMs would impact PCD performance. Due to space constraints, we plan to explore such aspects more in depth in future works.
